## 🎯 Problem We’re Solving

Planning an outdoor activity — a hike, event, or picnic — is often uncertain due to unpredictable weather.  
While most weather apps forecast only a few days ahead, **WeatherScope** analyzes **multi-decade NASA climate records** to compute how likely “very hot,” “very cold,” “very wet,” “very windy,” or “very uncomfortable” conditions are for any place and date of the year.

This empowers users to plan trips or events with **data-driven climate insight**, not just short-term forecasts.

## 🛰️ Data Sources & Methodology

WeatherScope integrates public **NASA Earth Observation Data Systems** for long-term historical weather patterns:

| NASA Source | Purpose / Use | Access Protocol |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **GES DISC / OPeNDAP (Hyrax)** | Provides long-term daily and monthly datasets for temperature, precipitation, windspeed, and humidity. | OPeNDAP endpoints used for subsetting by coordinates and time period. |
| **Giovanni** | For spatially averaged and climatological statistics over user-selected regions. | Accessed programmatically to compute time-series and climatology statistics. |
| **NASA Earthdata Search** | Enables retrieval of metadata, dataset identifiers, and global product access. | Used for linking datasets, metadata, and variable definitions. |

The backend processes these datasets to:
- Retrieve multi-year observations for a selected lat/lon and date.
- Calculate the probability that chosen variables exceed defined thresholds.
- Return summarized results and historical distributions for visualization.
- Provide metadata (units, dataset source, retrieval timestamp) with each result.

All calculations are **derived from NASA’s public climatological archives** rather than short-term weather APIs.

## 📊 Example Insight

> “For **Rishikesh, India** on **March 15**, NASA data shows:  
> 🌡️ Probability of temperature > 35 °C: **38 %**  
> 🌧️ Probability of rainfall > 20 mm: **15 %**  
> 🌬️ Probability of windspeed > 20 km/h: **22 %**  
> — Based on 20+ years of historical records.”
