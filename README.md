## 🎯 Problem We’re Solving

Planning an outdoor activity — a hike, event, or picnic — is often uncertain due to unpredictable weather.  
While most weather apps forecast only a few days ahead, **WeatherScope** analyzes **multi-decade NASA climate records** to compute how likely “very hot,” “very cold,” “very wet,” “very windy,” or “very uncomfortable” conditions are for any place and date of the year.

This empowers users to plan trips or events with **data-driven climate insight**, not just short-term forecasts.

## 🛰️ Data Sources & Methodology

WeatherScope integrates **real NASA climate datasets**:

| NASA Source | Variable / Use | Access Method |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **MERRA-2** (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis) | Air temperature, windspeed, humidity, surface fluxes | GES DISC / OPeNDAP |
| **IMERG / GPM** (Global Precipitation Measurement) | High-resolution rainfall detection, extreme precipitation | GES DISC / OPeNDAP |
| **NASA POWER** | Temperature, precipitation, windspeed — used for fast fallback | POWER REST API (JSON) |
| **GES DISC Hyrax OPeNDAP** | Climate variable subsetting by coordinate and date | OPeNDAP endpoints |
| **Giovanni** | Time series & climatology statistics | Programmatic queries |
| **Earthdata Search** | Dataset metadata, product discovery | Earthdata APIs |

The backend processes these datasets to:
✔ Retrieve multi-year observations for a selected lat/lon and date.
✔ Calculate the probability that chosen variables exceed defined thresholds.
✔ Return summarized results and historical distributions for visualization.
✔ Provide metadata (units, dataset source, retrieval timestamp) with each result.
✔ Checks extreme thresholds:
- Heat > 35°C  
- Cold < 5°C  
- Rain > 0.1mm (or custom)  
- Wind > 15 m/s  

✔ Computes:
- % probability  
- number of years analyzed  
- raw yearly values  
✔ Returns JSON results with source metadata  
✔ If high-res dataset fails → **POWER fallback**

Everything is derived from **NASA’s long-term datasets**, not short-range forecasts.


All calculations are **derived from NASA’s public climatological archives** rather than short-term weather APIs.
